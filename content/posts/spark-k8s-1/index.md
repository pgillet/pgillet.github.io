In the [previous article](../spark-k8s-0/index.html), we saw how to launch Spark applications with the Spark Operator. In this article, we'll see 
how to do the same thing, but natively with spark-submit. Let's first explain the differences between the two ways 
of deploying your driver on the worker nodes.

<!--more-->

# Client vs Cluster Mode

## Spark-submit in cluster mode

In _cluster mode_, your application is submitted from a machine far from the worker machines (e.g. locally on your 
laptop). You need a Spark distribution installed on this machine to be able to actually run the `spark-submit` script. 
In this mode, the script exits normally as soon as the application has been submitted. The driver is then detached and 
can run on its own in the kubernetes cluster. You can print the logs of the driver pod with the `kubectl logs` command 
to see the output of the application.

It is possible to use the authenticating `kubectl` proxy to communicate to the Kubernetes API.

The local proxy can be started by:

```bash
kubectl proxy &
```
If the local proxy is running at localhost:8001, the remote Kubernetes cluster can be reached by `spark-submit` by 
specifying `--master k8s://http://127.0.0.1:8001` as an argument to `spark-submit`.

## Spark-submit in client mode

In _client mode_, the `spark-submit` command is directly passed with its arguments to the Spark container in the driver 
pod. With the `deploy-mode` option set to `client`, the driver is launched directly within the `spark-submit` process 
which acts as a client to the cluster. The input and output of the application are attached to the logs from the pod.

![k8s client mode](k8s-client-mode.png)

## Who Does What?

With "native" Spark, we will execute Spark applications in client mode, so as not to depend on a local Spark 
distribution. Specifically, the user creates a driver pod resource with `kubectl`, and the driver pod will 
then run `spark-submit` in client mode internally to run the driver program.
 
With Spark Operator, a `SparkApplication` should set `.spec.deployMode` to `cluster`, as `client` is not currently
 implemented. Behind the scenes, the behavior is exactly the same as with native Spark: the operator's controller 
thus embeds a Spark distribution which plays the role of Spark scheduler; driver pods are spawned from the 
controller... and then run `spark-submit` in client mode internally to run the driver program. But this is globally 
transparent for the end user.

Additional details of how `SparkApplications` are run can be found in the 
[design documentation](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator/blob/master/docs/design.md#architecture).

# Driver Pod

With native Spark, the main resource is the driver pod.
To run the Pi example program like with the Spark Operator, the driver pod must be created using the data in the 
following YAML file:

`pyspark-pi-driver-pod.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app-name: pyspark-pi-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}
    spark-role: driver
  name: pyspark-pi-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}-driver
  namespace: ${NAMESPACE}
spec:

      name: headless-svc
    - containerPort: 4040
      name: web-ui

      requests:
        memory: 512Mi
        cpu: 1
      limits:
        cpu: 1200m
    env:
    # Overriding configuration directory
    - name: SPARK_CONF_DIR
      value: /spark-conf
    - name: SPARK_HOME
      value: /opt/spark
    # Configure all key-value pairs in ConfigMap as container environment variables
    envFrom:
      - configMapRef:
          name: pyspark-pi-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}-cm
    args:
    - $(SPARK_HOME)/bin/spark-submit
    - /opt/spark/examples/src/main/python/pi.py
    - "10"
    volumeMounts:
      - name: spark-config
        mountPath: /spark-conf
        readOnly: true
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
            - key: type
              operator: In
              values: [${DRIVER_NODE_AFFINITIES}]
  priorityClassName: ${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
  schedulerName: volcano
  serviceAccountName: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}
  volumes:
    # Add the executor pod template in read-only volume, for the driver to read
    - name: spark-config
      configMap:
        name: pyspark-pi-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}-cm
        items:
        - key: spark-defaults.conf
          path: spark-defaults.conf
        - key: spark-env.sh
          path: spark-env.sh
        - key: executor-pod-template.yaml
          path: executor-pod-template.yaml
```

**Don't pay attention to the variable placeholders for now**, even though you can imagine what they can be used for.

As you can see, the driver pod depends on other Kubernetes resources. We will detail each of them.

# Spark Configuration

We use a [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) for setting Spark configuration
 data separately from the driver pod definition.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    app-name: spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}
  name: spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}-cm
  namespace: ${NAMESPACE}
data:
  # Comma-separated list of .zip, .egg, or .py files dependencies for Python apps.
  # spark.submit.pyFiles can be used instead in spark-defaults.conf below.
  # PYTHONPATH: ...
  spark-env.sh: |
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    export DUMMY=dummy
    echo "Here we are, ${DUMMY}!"
  spark-defaults.conf: |
    spark.master                                k8s://https://kubernetes.default

    spark.driver.host                           spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}-driver-svc
    spark.driver.port                           5678

    # Config params for use with an ingress to expose the Web UI

    spec:

              - key: type
                operator: In
                values: [${EXECUTOR_NODE_AFFINITIES}]
      priorityClassName: ${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}
      schedulerName: volcano
```

## Executor Pod Template

We use a template file in the `ConfigMap` to define the executor pod configuration. 
[Templates](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-kubernetes.html#pod-template) are typically used for
 configuring Spark pods that cannot be configured otherwise, via Spark properties or environment variables
 . Thus, template files mostly contain fine-grained configuration related to deployment at the Kubernetes level: 
here, the node affinity and the priority class name.

To make the pod template file accessible to the spark-submit process, we must set the Spark property 
`spark.kubernetes.executor.podTemplateFile` with its local pathname in the driver pod. To do so, the file will be 
automatically mounted onto a volume in the driver pod when it’s created.

## Executor Pod Garbage Collection

We must also set `spark.kubernetes.driver.pod.name` for the executors to the name of the driver pod. When this
 property is set, the Spark scheduler will deploy the executor pods with an `ownerReference`, which in turn will
  ensure that once the driver pod is deleted from the cluster, all of the application’s executor pods will also be
   deleted.

# Client Mode Networking

In client mode, the driver runs inside a pod. Spark executors must be able to connect to the Spark driver by the 
means of Kubernetes networking. To do that, we use
 a [headless](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) service to allow
  the driver pod to be routable from the executors by a stable hostname. When deploying the headless service, we
  ensure that the service will only match the driver pod and no other pods by assigning the driver pod a
   (sufficiently) unique label and by using that label in the `label selector` of the headless service. We can then
    pass to the executors the driver’s hostname via `spark.driver.host` with the service name and the spark driver’s
     port to `spark.driver.port`.

`spark-driver-svc.yaml`     
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app-name: spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}
  name: spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}-driver-svc
  namespace: spark-jobs
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  ports:
  - name: 5678-5678
    port: 5678
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 5678
  selector:
    app-name: spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}
    spark-role: driver
  type: ClusterIP
```

# Spark UI

## Ingress

The Spark UI is accessible by creating a service of type `ClusterIP` which exposes the UI from the driver pod:

`spark-ui-svc.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app-name: spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}
  name: spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}-ui-svc
  namespace: spark-jobs
spec:
  ports:
  - name: spark-driver-ui-port
    port: 4040
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 4040
  selector:
    app-name: spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}
    spark-role: driver
  type: ClusterIP
```

With this service alone, the UI is only accessible from inside the cluster. We must then create an `Ingress` to expose 
the UI outside the cluster. In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an ingress controller 
running. You can choose the 
[ingress controller implementation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) 
that best fits your cluster. 
[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-ingress/) and 
[Nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) are very popular choices. The ingress below is configured for 
Nginx: 

`spark-ui-ingress.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  labels:
    app-name: spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}
  name: spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}-ui-ingress
  namespace: spark-jobs
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-redirect-from: "http://$host/"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-redirect-to: "http://$host/spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}/"
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}(/|$)(.*)
        backend:
          serviceName: spark-${PRIORITY_CLASS_NAME}${NAME_SUFFIX}-ui-svc
          servicePort: 4040
```

The Ingress is backed by as many services as driver pods that run concurrently in the cluster. Each UI must then be
 addressed with a unique `path` in the Ingress. The path in question is directly derived from the name of the Spark
  application, with its unique ID. 
  
The interface is always available at `http://<driver-pod-ip>:4040` (from inside the cluster), as each driver pod is
 assigned a unique IP and there is only one `SparkContext` running in the pod host (otherwise, the UI would be bound
  to successive ports beginning with 4040: 4041, 4042, etc).
  
So, natively, the different UIs that might be available at a given time on a same host are only differentiated by their
 assigned port number. The UI has been designed following that principle, and all HTTP operations are performed
  relatively to the same root path in the URL, which is...`/`.
  
So for the UI to be effectively accessible through the Ingress, we must set up HTTP redirection with an alternative
 root path (the one configured in the Ingress). To work smoothly, the UI itself must be aware of this redirection by
  setting `spark.ui.proxyBase` to this root path...and that's it!

### Spark Operator

The operator supports creating an optional Ingress for the Spark Web UI. This can be turned on by setting the
 `ingress-url-format` command-line flag. The `ingress-url-format` should be a template like 
 `{{$appName}}.{ingress_suffix}/{{$appNamespace}}/{{$appName}}`. The `{ingress_suffix}` should be replaced by the user
  to indicate the cluster's Ingress url and the operator will replace the `{{$appName}}` and `{{$appNamespace}}` with
   the appropriate value. Please note that Ingress support requires that cluster's Ingress url routing is correctly
    setup. For e.g. if the `ingress-url-format` is `{{$appName}}.ingress.cluster.com`, it requires that anything
     `*.ingress.cluster.com` should be routed to the Ingress controller on the K8s cluster.
     
Example of Spark Operator install with the `ingress-url-format` command-line flag:

```bash
./helm install spark-operator incubator/sparkoperator --namespace spark-operator --set enableWebhook=true --set enableBatchScheduler=true --set ingressUrlFormat="\{\{\$appName\}\}.ingress.cluster.com"
```

Note that curly braces must be escaped.

## Future Work

I could not enable the Spark Operator Ingress during my experiments, simply because a DNS name is required. Instead, 
the same Ingress as for native Spark is "grafted" to the `SparkApplication`, with path-based routing.
 
The operation proposed by the Spark Operator, with routing based on hostname wildcards (for example 
`*.ingress.cluster.com`), is nevertheless interesting as it would overcome the problem of HTTP redirect described
 above.
 
With hostname wildcards, and therefore without the HTTP redirect, the UI service could be switched to `NodePort` 
type (a NodePort service exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port) and still be compatible with the 
Ingress.
The UI would thus be accessible outside the cluster through both the Ingress with its external URL configured, and the 
`NodePort` service at `http://<node-ip>:<service-port>`. A service of type `NodePort` is still relevant in a private 
cloud.

# Object Names and Labels

We use the `app-name` label to semantically group all the Kubernetes resources related to a single Spark application.
In our case, this label provides uniqueness, and we do not expect multiple Spark applications to carry the same value 
for this label (at least in the _namespace-time_ considered).

For a given Spark application, all the object names are then derived from the `app-name`. We simply add a suffix which 
also qualifies the type of the object: `-driver` for the driver pod, `-driver-svc` for the driver service, `-ui-svc` 
for the Spark UI service, `-ui-ingress` for the Spark UI ingress, and `-cm` for the ConfigMap.

We also set the label `spark-role` at the pod level to differentiate the drivers from their executors.

This naming and labeling is consistent with the Spark Operator. As a result, Spark applications can be treated and 
filtered in the same way, whether they are launched with the Spark Operator or with spark-submit. :thumbsup:

# Deployment

We have now managed to mimic the same behavior we got with the Spark Operator, here is what we have deployed in 
Kubernetes:

![spark-submit](spark-submit.png)

Now that we've defined all of our Kubernetes resources for spark-submit, we're going to get our hands on some Python 
code to orchestrate all of this. See you in the [third and final article](../spark-k8s-2/index.html) in this series.
